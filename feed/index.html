Being a pioneer in its field of <a href="http://www.bestradardetectorreviewss.com/" target="_blank">radar detectors</a>, it decided to take things a step further by introducing a cordless detector. Note that although this device performs well and matches as well as exceeds some of its counterparts; you will be sacrificing some features in exchange for the portability that this device has to offer. Read on to know if the price and feature scale balances.</p>
<h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>
<h3>Long-range Radar Protection</h3>
<p>The Solo S3 covers all the standard signals and frequencies. These include the X-band, K-band and the Ka band well. Instant on signals can be detected as well. The detecting system has received an overhaul which greatly has improved, itâs detection capabilities in terms of range.</p>
<h3>Ultra-Performance Laser Protection</h3>
<p>Detecting speed radars using signal bands can sometimes deceive a person and get them caught. This is because of laser operated speed radars. These donât utilize signals at all and therefore are completely invisible on their own to detectors. The SOLO S3 comes with multiple sensors which can detect laser beams. The sensors cover wide fields of view while operating at low-noise frequencies to ensure maximum protection against lasers.</p>
<h3>Programmable Features</h3>
<p>The SOLO S3 doesnât lag behind on customizable functions either. You get to choose from 9 different types of driving modes. If the battery gets you worried about your settings reset, then here is another plus. The Solo S3 saves your setting in its internal memory so even if itâs without power there is no effect on the settings saved.</p>
<h3>High-resolution Graphic Display</h3>
<p>The Solo S3âs display has been revamped as well. Escort used OLED technology, which makes for easy reading. Everything is neatly organized on the display and one glance is more than enough to pick up on what type of alert is being given. Furthermore, you can use bar graphs as well as the patented expert meter; whichever suits your preferences.</p>
<h3>Safety Radar Signals</h3>
<p>Just like the other Escort models, the Solo S3 can provide up to 64 different alerts. These alerts are detected by its Safety Warning technology.</p>
<h3>Opening the box</h3>
<p>You can start operating the Solo S3 in almost no time right out of the box. Just put in the AA batteries that come with it and youâre good to go. Of course, if youâre not the technical type, then itâd be a good idea to go through the manual as well. It gives detailed instructions not only on operations, but correct installation as well.</p>
<p>Note that incorrect installation can have adverse effects on the deviceâs detection capabilities and has been the reason for many negative reviews and responses from buyers.</p>
<p>The box includes an adjustable windshield mounting device and travel case as well.</p>
<h3>High-Efficiency Battery Design</h3>
<p>A high efficiency design <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004S22KFE/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004S22KFE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rdetectorr-20&amp;linkId=4P6IBRFVMIGDPYFJ" target="_blank">ensures that the Solo S3 consumes </a>a lot less power than its corded counterparts. This ensures long battery running times of up to months! In the case that the batteries are low, you will be notified on the spot rather than when theyâre right about to end.</p>
<h2><strong>Pros</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>No hassle with cords.</li>
<li>Long time operation on battery</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Cons</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>The short detection range at times due to battery powered operation as compared to corded devices. (Mixed responses to this from customers)</li>
<li>Windshield mounts are not sturdy enough.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Testimonials</strong></h2>
<p>With an overall review of 75 5 stars 23 4 stars, the Solo S3 have fared well among customers. There were 8 3, 2 and 1 star reviews who complained about the lack of detection range.</p>
<h2><strong>Recommendations</strong></h2>
<p>If you are the travelling type, then this is the device for you. Be ready to trade some performance for portability though. Coming to the different drive modes, itâs a really helpful feature, if the device has multiple users. Different people in a firm, for different locations, different vehicles; numerous factors can be addressed using these 9 different modes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LZUY8A/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002LZUY8A&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rdetectorr-20&amp;linkId=EC2INKGGGUVGKQFO" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-20 aligncenter" src="http://www.bestradardetectorreviewss.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Escort-0100006-2-RedLine-Radar-Detector-big.jpg" alt="Escort-0100006-2-RedLine-Radar-Detector big" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>The RedLine isnât your ordinary run of the mill device. Designed to pick up on even the slightest of signal emanations, this device cannot possibly fail to detect a checkpoint if there is one. Of course, thatâs not saying much considering the price tag which comes with it. But weâll let you be the judge of that once youâve gone through the review completely.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LZUY8A/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002LZUY8A&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rdetectorr-20&amp;linkId=EC2INKGGGUVGKQFO" target="_blank">RedLine comes with full K, Ka and X support.</a> Apart from that you get the Safety Warning System, which really adds to the overall radar capability. The list doesnât end here. Extras include a rear and front system for laser detection so youâre covered there as well.</p>
<p>Rather than taking the traditional route; the Redline comes with a dual antenna. Couple this with a varactor-tuned (VTO) receiver and a digitally processed signal system (DSP) and you get one really sophisticated device for your car. The improved range means you know well in advance of any possible units up ahead.</p>
<h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Band support</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, this device scans for all major bands available. Apart from that it will also detect on other types of uncommon signals or hazards and obstructions on roads ahead.</p>
<h3><strong>Range</strong></h3>
<p>Many manufacturers use technical jargon and other fancy words to mask the lacking of their product in terms of range. However, there is no need for that here. The Redline comes with two antennas rather than the industry standard of one. Couple this with the V-tuned receiver programming and you get a device which can detect a unit from so far that you may even brake and then speed up again only to remember the unit is still far away!</p>
<h3><strong>Detecting the detector; Undetectable</strong></h3>
<p>The truth, however bitter, is the truth. Many states have detectors banned altogether. If youâre found with one, then youâll be in for a lot more than just the usual speeding ticket. Detectors are detected using sophisticated devices which can pick up devices detecting other signals. The Redline comes with TotalSheild RF technology. This technology picks up on and bounces back waves used by <a href="http://www.bestradardetectorreviewss.com/" target="_blank">detector detecting detectors</a> hence rendering your device virtually invisible to it.</p>
<h3><strong>Safety radar</strong></h3>
<p>Picking up on checkpoints and units isnât the only function this device serves. Itâs safety radar can pick up on different types of situations such as constructions up ahead, fast/slow moving vehicles, weather conditions, road clearance and a lot more. By factory defaults the device comes with close to 70 different messages which notify you specifically of what it has detected and will come up ahead.</p>
<h3><strong>Warranty</strong></h3>
<p>The device comes with a one-year limited warranty. It can also be extended according to the different plans the company has to offer; you can check them out on their site. Having warranty is a major advantage; many software issues occur during upgrades and these can easily be sorted out through warranty.</p>
<h2><strong>Pros</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Excellent display screen</li>
<li>One year warranty</li>
<li>Undetectable</li>
<li>Dual antennae allows for long range detections and hence earlier alerts</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Cons</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Too many fees involved to get updates</li>
<li>Doesnât detect well on sides other than the front of the vehicle</li>
<li>Requires perfect mounting position</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Testimonials</strong></h2>
<p>Although ratings were the highest at 5 stars (close to a 100), there were downsides of the product mentioned as well since updating involved hefty costs such as membership fees. Apart from that, the device was well received since it could make detections really far out.</p>
<h2><strong>Recommendations</strong></h2>
<p>This shouldnât be your first buy. It takes some time getting used to the features and wonât work well if you donât understand its functions thoroughly.</p>

<p>Let nothing get in your way when it comes to avoiding those pesky speeding tickets; not even your budget. The Beltronics Vector V955 Radar Detector strikes the perfect balance between cost and what you get in return in the form of speed ticket savings and avoiding those hassles altogether. Rated by many customers as the best buy for its price; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009SCMKY/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0009SCMKY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rdetectorr-20&amp;linkId=ED6KQXG3BOXPRVTT" target="_blank">the Vector V955 is one product </a>you shouldnât miss out on.</p>
<h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Superior Detection</strong></h3>
<p>The Vector 955 covers all the different types of signal bands. Be it the K or Ka band, super wide or normal, X band or pop mode; this device has got you covered. Not only that, but it also includes safety warning features.</p>
<h3><strong>Ease of use</strong></h3>
<p>Durability is the name of the game if youâve got the main functions covered. Many devices focus on getting in the best performance only in terms of detection. They fail to give due importance to other aspects. Some devices lag behind with heat up issues, others donât mount properly and some arenât durable enough.</p>
<p>The Vector 955 has these points in check however. Automatic muting technology reduces the hassles of false alarms and silencing alerts by almost 50%! Couple that with its option to customize preferences such as alert timings, detections, sound levels and you get one irresistible package altogether.</p>
<p>The control panel and buttons are located on the top of the device so you can easily configure and operate as needed.</p>
<h3><strong>Setting up the device</strong></h3>
<p>Many a times it happens that you use different cars; sometimes the office car, sometimes the home car and sometimes the weekend sports convertible. It is pretty obvious that you wouldnât have bothered to read this review if you had enough money to buy a device for each car separately. Thankfully the Vector V955 can be easily installed and setup. It has a quick release mechanism which allows it to be affixed to the windshield through its mount. It can be easily removed as well.</p>
<p><strong>AutoScan Mode</strong></p>
<p>AutoScan ensures you are protected at all times. You donât have to run frequent scans or set up the device when approaching turns or open spots. The V955 is up and running full time and its computer is on the lookout for any suspicious signals it picks up.</p>
<h3><strong>Bright LED Display</strong></h3>
<p>Audio notifications and beeps are one thing. What you need is detailed information about any detection that takes place. Once you get experienced and used to detectors; youâll rely mostly on the display to gather enough of an idea to dismiss or consider an alert. The V955 has a 280-LED screen which displays a wide variety of parameters such as signal strength, type, and so on.</p>
<h3><strong>Safety Warning system</strong></h3>
<p>The safety warning system is an altogether unique option of this detector. It makes the device a versatile warning device and helps alert you of any upcoming hazards such as obstructions or construction work taking place ahead. This means you not only save on tickets, but are also saved from potential driving hazards.</p>
<h2><strong>Pros</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Safety warning system</li>
<li>Customizable driving modes</li>
<li>Good value for money</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Cons</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Lesser working life in comparison to other models</li>
<li>Poor customer after service</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Testimonials</strong></h2>
<p>On the whole responses were positive with 160 5 stars in the lead, followed by close to a 100 4 stars. Apart from customer service issues, only some service issues irked customers.</p>
<h2><strong>Recommendations</strong></h2>
<p>Considering the pros and the cons it can be said that <a href="http://www.bestradardetectorreviewss.com/" target="_blank">the device makes for a great buy;</a> especially keeping in view the cost. If maintained properly and used wisely; this device performs no less than high end devices.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IQGU0A/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B005IQGU0A&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rdetectorr-20&amp;linkId=27NINSBXYZMHKL5E" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11" src="http://www.bestradardetectorreviewss.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Escort-Passport-8500X50-Detector-Display-big.jpg" alt="Escort-Passport-8500X50-Detector-Display big" width="458" height="458" /></a></p>
<p>If youâve ever owned an Escort Passport before then youâll know the PASSPORT 8500 X50 for what it is the moment you feast your eyes on the rest of this review. The X50 Black, if we speak in generous and general terms, has been gauged to give an incredibly improved performance of close to 50%! The improvements come in various forms such as better overall build, additional accessories and equipment and last but not least; the features.</p>
<p>A major improvement made has been to the radarâs detection capabilities. Having a V-tuned the device; it can now search and detect radar signals from far away, meaning itâs range has increased and can detect signals even earlier and at more distance than before. This technology can detect different types of signals such as POP mode radars and X-Bands. As if this wasnât enough; not only does the PASSPORT 8500 X50 detect on K and KA signals as well but does so at a tremendously improved range.</p>
<h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>
<h3>Radar Protection has taken to the next level</h3>
<p>What do you get when you upgrade a <a href="http://www.bestradardetectorreviewss.com/" target="_blank">conventional radar detector </a>by V-tuning it? How do fast and more accurate detections sound? Thatâs right. The Passport 8500 X50 now has an improved detection range and a better algorithm to identify different types of signals and prioritize them. Not only that, but it can also easily channel out the false alarms as well.</p>
<h3>Exclusive AutoSensitivity Mode</h3>
<p>With the carefulness that you exercise when listening to detections on a device comes the problems of false alerts. This device comes with AutoSensitivity technology, which allows it to identify and distinguish between actual alerts and detections based on insignificant objects. Couple this with the Traffic Signal Rejection (TSR) program which automatically mutes alert regarding traffic sensors and you get an intelligent device which rarely gives false alarms.</p>
<h3>Laser Protection</h3>
<p>Laser detection is no easy feat. However the Passport 8500 X50 has unique off-axis protection technology, which improves laser detection capabilities and allow you be notified of them as well.</p>
<h3>Brightness Control</h3>
<p>Not a major option but something we could all do with considering detectors, once bought, form an integral part of the car. You can set the brightness at 3 different levels as per external and internal lighting conditions.</p>
<h2><strong>Pros</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Good price.</li>
<li>Improved radar detection range</li>
<li>Different brightness settings for optimal viewing</li>
<li>Programmable alert modes for different driving patterns</li>
<li>Different display modes</li>
<li>Commendable laser protection when used in conjunction with a laser shifter</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>ConsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Some users had trouble mounting the device</li>
<li>Has operating issues in cold weather</li>
<li>The single, multi-touch volume button is a hassle at times</li>
<li>Customer service issues have come up when claiming warranties and repairs</li>
<li>Not every effective with red light cameras</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Testimonials</strong></h2>
<p>The product, as for any Escort product, has received 120 5 star reviews compared to 50 4 star reviews and only 17, 10 and 13 3, 2 and 1 star reviews respectively. If we look at this critically then there were a few complaints regarding the mounts and a few other minor issues but on the whole the device was well praised.</p>
<h2><strong>Recommendations</strong></h2>
<p>This is the device to go for. Of course youâd be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IQGU0A/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B005IQGU0A&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rdetectorr-20&amp;linkId=27NINSBXYZMHKL5E" target="_blank">wondering why you should buy this </a>considering the huge list of cons. The thing is that these were only mentioned to point out there is barely anything wrong with it. These are minor issues and are almost nothing compared to what many people face with other brands.</p>
<p>The device, with its improved range will be able to alert you well in advance and help you save on a number of speeding tickets. Once youâre experienced with different signal bands; youâll be able to tell from false alarms yourself.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F0RPGG/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001F0RPGG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rdetectorr-20&amp;linkId=B6VM7SZUXYF5BIW7" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-9 aligncenter" src="http://www.bestradardetectorreviewss.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Escort-Passport-9500ix-Detector-Display-big.jpg" alt="Escort-Passport-9500ix-Detector-Display big" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Sometimes people find themselves in situations they wish they couldâve avoided. Some of these situations are such that happen to people who, on the whole, are at their very best behavior, but still get sucked into the whirlpool of negativities.</p>
<p>Enough on karma; letâs get to <a href="http://www.bestradardetectorreviewss.com/" target="_blank">radar and laser detectors</a>. The Escort Passport 9500ix has literally got so many features packed into it; theyâll make you forget what the actual reason was for you to buy this product. Features such as the False Alarm eliminator using GPS filters, Automatic learning with AI protection, location marking and variable speed, sensitivity make this a radar detector which serve a lot more purposes than just occupying some space above your dashboard.</p>
<h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Anti-False Alert</strong></h3>
<p>If youâve owned and used a radar detector for some time now and have had problems with false alerts then this feature will come to you as a major sigh of relief. False alerts can be a major source of annoyance for many. Unfortunately, alerts are alerts; whether false or an actual detection. A radar detector is designed to catch up on any time of signals. But hereâs something more.</p>
<p>The Escort Passport 9500ix doesnât just alert you of any signals it picks up, but also records different detections. Take the example of the alerts you get when crossing the mall. When you pass it by your device starts beeping. Rather than having to mute it every time you can simply âteachâ it to ignore the current detection from now on. Do this by pressing the mute button thrice. No more will you hear a beep when the device picks up on that particular signal.</p>
<h3><strong>AutoLearn: Artificial Intelligence Protection</strong></h3>
<p>The Escort Passport 9500ix is programmed to âlearnâ and differentiate between actual alerts and false ones. This system is similar to the way a carâs ECU picks up on driving patterns and accordingly adjusts for engine RPM and other functions. Requiring only a triple press from the driver as feedback about a location; the Escort Passport 9500ix will categorize that locationâs signals as a false alert and not bother you again.</p>
<p>However the device only automatically mutes out false alerts if they retain their coordinates and frequencies. For example, if a signal in an area is different from the one stored in memory it will automatically beep rather than muting this new signal as well.</p>
<h2><strong>Pros </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Auto-learn. Can automatically learn and ignore false alerts.</li>
<li>Maintains locations. Can record locations and provide information on cameras and other warnings. Database updateable from the internet</li>
<li>Variable speed sensor. Reduces alerts if the vehicle speed is within limits altogether.</li>
